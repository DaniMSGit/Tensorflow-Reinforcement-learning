## Getting Started

The file Launcher.py allows the execution of the platform both in training and in test. The configuration parameters are found in the hyperparameters.json file.

### Prerequisites

It is necessary to have installed and configured Tensorflow in the equipment, in addition, to import all the necessary libraries, that the compiler requires, such as Keras.
